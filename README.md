# ConstrainedKnapsackAlgorithm
Solves for optimal 0-1 knapsack solution given weight and quantity limits.

I designed this algorithm to optimize daily fantasy sports lineups, as players have prices and expected values, and the overall lineup has caps on both overall cost and lineup size. I determine expected values for each player with a model that is separate from this algorithm.

Run main.py to use. I need to implement easier input selection. Right now, program only has hard-coded data. Requires openpyxl, the Excel library.

The Excel file, matrixSet, is an example of a final, optimal solution set.
